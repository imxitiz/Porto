## OAuth Setup for Developers

Porto uses Bluesky OAuth. The extension is configured with this client metadata URL by default:

`https://nester-xyz.github.io/Porto/oauth-client-metadata.json`

Use this checklist when setting up or updating OAuth:

1. Host `oauth-client-metadata.json` publicly over HTTPS (GitHub Pages is the default).
   This repo includes `.github/workflows/oauth-metadata-pages.yml` to publish it.
2. Keep `client_id` in that JSON exactly equal to the hosted URL.
3. Keep `redirect_uris` aligned with the production callback URL:
   `https://ckilhjdflnaakopknngigiggfpnjaaop.chromiumapp.org/oauth2`
4. If hosting URL or extension ID changes, update both:
   - `oauth-client-metadata.json`
   - `src/lib/auth/oauth.ts`
5. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for this repo with source set to "GitHub Actions".
6. Verify the metadata endpoint after deployment:
   - `curl -i https://nester-xyz.github.io/Porto/oauth-client-metadata.json`
   - Expect `HTTP/2 200` and `Content-Type: application/json`.
7. For local unpacked extension testing, use a dev OAuth profile:
   - Host a dev metadata JSON at your own HTTPS URL.
   - Keep that JSON `client_id` exactly equal to the hosted URL.
   - Keep `redirect_uris` equal to your unpacked extension callback from
     `chrome.identity.getRedirectURL("oauth2")`.
   - Set these in your local `.env.local`:
     - `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_DEV_CLIENT_ID=<your-hosted-dev-metadata-url>`
     - `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_DEV_REDIRECT_URI=<your-unpacked-extension-callback-url>`

Optional build-time OAuth overrides:

- `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`
- `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_DEV_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_BSKY_OAUTH_DEV_REDIRECT_URI`

Expected OAuth session behavior:

- Session should persist across popup closes and browser restarts.
- Re-login is expected only after explicit sign-out, token revoke/invalid session, or cleared browser extension storage.
